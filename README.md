# Active Records

This is a project aimed at studying PHP Data Objects (PDO), an extension of PHP that provides a uniform interface for accessing relational databases.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to understand and practice the use of PDO for interacting with relational databases in PHP. During this study, we will cover the following topics:

- Configuration and connection to the PostgreSQL database.
- Execution of SQL queries using PDO.
- Use of prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
- Handling transactions.
- Error and exception handling.
- Best practices and tips for efficient use of PDO.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app/`: Directory containing the PHP application.
    - `Database/`: Directory containing classes related to database connection.
        - `Connection.php`: Class responsible for establishing the PDO connection to the PostgreSQL database.
    - `index.php`: Main file of the application, where PDO functionalities are demonstrated.
